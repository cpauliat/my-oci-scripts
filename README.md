# my oci-scripts

Scripts I developed for OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) using OCI CLI, OCI Python SDK or OCI Go SDK
with precious help from Matthieu Bordonne

As the number of scripts increases, I store them in different folders:

| Folder                 | Related OCI resources                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **oci_iam**            | Identification and Access Management |
| **oci_compute**        | Compute (instances, images, ...)     |
| **oci_network**        | Network                              |
| **oci_block_storage**  | Block storage                        |
| **oci_object_storage** | Object Storage                       |
| **oci_database**       | Oracle Database                      |
| **oci_streaming**      | Streaming                            |
| **oci_misc**           | Miscellaneous (everything else)      |

See README.md files in each folder for more details about the scripts.

IMPORTANT: I am employed by Oracle, however, all code found in this repository is proof-of-concept, used primarily for demonstration purposes, and is not supported by Oracle. The code here should not be used, as is, for Production purposes... otherwise, enjoy !
